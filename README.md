# Simple REST API Auth

**Simple REST API Auth** is a beginner project aimed at creating a basic authentication system using Go. This project serves as an introduction to building RESTful APIs and implementing JWT-based authentication in Go. It showcases fundamental concepts and practices in web development, making it an excellent starting point for anyone new to Go and web development.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The primary programming language used for developing this API.
- **net/http**: The standard library used for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing user information and refresh tokens.
- **Slog**: Structured logging library to provide clear and actionable logs.
- **Validator**: For validating request payloads to ensure they meet expected formats.

This project serves as a practical exercise to understand the core principles of RESTful API design, authentication, and authorization with Golang. It can be expanded upon with additional features such as user roles, permissions, and more complex error handling.
